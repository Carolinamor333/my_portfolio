# Hi! Welcome to your portfolio!

This is the repository (the place where your code is saved) for your website portfolio! We'll be working on this on every Tech Tuesday workshop until the end of the semester, when we end up hosting it online for free!

## How to start!

### 1 - Make a copy of this template, click on the green button that says "use this template", then on "create a new repository"

### 2 - Give your portfolio repository a name (I recommend portfolio, my-portfolio or whatever tickles you fancy)

### 3 -  Go to the green button that says Code and copy the HTTPS url

### 4 - Go to Visual Studio Code (or whatever IDE tickles you fancy) and clone the repository. 
To do this, make a new Window on VSCode (File > New Window), then click on clone repository and copy that HTTPS url from step 3. It will ask you for a folder to save your code in, make a new one and save your stuff

# What to do now?
Well either you can start coding and having fun or just keep coming to the workshops! I'll keep adding more guides to this as we keep progressing!
